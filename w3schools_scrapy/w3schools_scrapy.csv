Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line:
Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability 
only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:
Syntax Error:
The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has 
to be at least one.
You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, 
otherwise Python will give you an error:
Syntax Error:
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:

Variables in Python:
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
You will learn more about variables in the 
 chapter.
Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Comments in Python:
Insert the missing part of the code below to output ""Hello World""."
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_comments.asp,python_comments,"Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
Comments starts with a 
, and Python will 
ignore them:
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest 
of the line:
A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to 
prevent Python from executing code:
Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a 
 for each line:
Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
Comments in Python are written with a special character, which one?"
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp,python_variables,"Variables are containers for storing data values.
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular 
, and can even change type after they have been set.
If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
You can get the data type of a variable with the 
 function.
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
Variable names are case-sensitive.
This will create two variables:"
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_getstarted.asp,python_getstarted,"Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.
To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:
If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the following website: 
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
Where ""helloworld.py"" is the name of your python file.
Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.
helloworld.py
Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
The output should read:
Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.
To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.
Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:
From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:
Which will write ""Hello, World!"" in the command line:
Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit the python command line interface:"
